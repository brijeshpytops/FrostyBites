    - Must be at least 8 characters long.
    - Must contain at least one uppercase letter (A-Z).
    - Must contain at least one lowercase letter (a-z).
    - Must contain at least one digit (0-9).
    - Must contain at least one special character from the set "#@._".

    Args:
        password (str): The password to be validated.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple where:
               - The first value is a boolean, True if the password is valid, False otherwise.
               - The second value is a message (str) explaining the validation result.
                 If the password is valid, the message will be an empty string.
                 If the password is invalid, the message will explain why.

    Example:
        >>> is_valid_password("Password123#")
